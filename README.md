# Wedding Website (Static GitHub Pages Site)

A clean, elegant, mobile-friendly wedding website that can be hosted directly on GitHub Pages with **no build step**.

## What this website is for

This site gives family and friends one place to find all key wedding information:

- Wedding date and quick overview
- Venue information
- Day-of schedule
- RSVP instructions
- Travel and accommodation notes
- FAQ
- Photo gallery

Everything is static HTML/CSS/JS, so it is easy to edit and publish.

## To edit the website

Use these quick examples:

1. **Change names in `index.html`**
   - Find the hero section and update the couple names (example: `Alex & Taylor`).
2. **Change colors in `style.css`**
   - Edit CSS variables at the top inside `:root` (for background, accent, text, etc.).
3. **Change gallery images in `assets/images`**
   - Replace `gallery-1.svg` etc. with your own files.
   - Keep file names the same OR update the image paths in `index.html`.
4. **Update RSVP link in `index.html`**
   - Find the RSVP button and replace `href="#"` with your real form URL.

Tip: Search for `EDIT HERE` comments in `index.html` to quickly find placeholders.

## How to replace images

### Hero image

1. Add your hero image to `assets/images/`.
2. In `style.css`, update this line in `.hero`:

```css
url("assets/images/hero-placeholder.svg")
```

Replace it with your file path (for example, `hero.jpg`).

### Gallery images

1. Put your photos in `assets/images/`.
2. In `index.html`, update each `<img src="assets/images/gallery-#.svg">` as needed.
3. Update `alt` text for accessibility.

---

## Publish to GitHub Pages

1. Push this repository to GitHub.
2. Open your repository on GitHub.
3. Go to **Settings → Pages**.
4. Under **Build and deployment**:
   - Source: **Deploy from a branch**
   - Branch: `main` (or your default branch)
   - Folder: `/ (root)`
5. Click **Save**.
6. Wait for deployment, then open the Pages URL GitHub provides.

## Connect a custom domain

1. Buy or use an existing domain from your domain provider.
2. In GitHub repo **Settings → Pages**, add your domain in **Custom domain** and save.
3. In your domain DNS settings, point records to GitHub Pages:
   - Use GitHub Pages A/ALIAS/CNAME records according to GitHub documentation.
4. (Recommended) Enable **Enforce HTTPS** in GitHub Pages settings after DNS is active.
5. Allow DNS propagation (can take minutes to 48 hours).

## Notes for beginners

- You can edit files directly on GitHub using the web editor.
- No Node.js, package manager, or backend is required.
- If something looks wrong, confirm file paths are relative and correctly spelled.
- Keep `index.html` in the root directory so GitHub Pages can load your homepage.



## RSVP flow (new)

The RSVP button now opens `rsvp.html`, where guests can submit:

- Full name
- Attendance (`yes` or `no`)
- Number of guests
- Notes (optional)

### Where RSVP data is saved

- **Production (recommended):** set `RSVP_ENDPOINT` in `rsvp.js` to a real form endpoint (Formspree, Supabase Edge Function, Google Apps Script, etc.).
- **Without endpoint:** data is only stored in the guest browser `localStorage` for testing.

> Important: if you want to track attendance centrally, you must connect a real backend endpoint.
